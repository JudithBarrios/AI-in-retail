For this project, I decided to go with LLM Option A: OpenAI API. The main reason was its ease of use, strong text generation capabilities, and overall reliability. Since I was working on a retail-focused application, I needed something that could generate clear and engaging product descriptions with minimal hassle. OpenAI’s GPT-4o turned out to be a great choice because it produces high-quality, context-aware responses that make customer interactions feel more natural. Another advantage was that using an API meant I didn’t have to worry about running large models locally, which made integration much smoother.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was dealing with API rate limits, especially when handling multiple requests in a short time frame, which occasionally caused delays in response generation. Another challenge was ensuring consistent response quality, as slight variations in prompts could lead to significantly different outputs. This required careful prompt engineering and multiple iterations to fine-tune the input in a way that consistently generated the most relevant and engaging descriptions. This required some trial and error with prompt engineering to make sure responses were both useful and efficient. Looking ahead, I think adding real-time customer sentiment analysis could make the application even more responsive and personalized. Another interesting direction would be incorporating image recognition so users could search for products visually. Of course, with any AI-driven system, ethical concerns need to be considered, especially in making sure recommendations are fair, transparent, and respectful of user privacy.
